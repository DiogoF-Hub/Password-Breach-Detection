    ### Welcome to the Password Breach Detection Tool
    This tool helps you check if your password has been compromised in known data breaches. It also allows you to:
    - Search for a specific password in the database.
    - Download and manage the breached passwords database.
    - Analyze the most frequently seen passwords in breaches.
    - Add your own passwords to the database for testing purposes.

    **Currently, there are two database options available for download:**

    1. **OneDrive (Recommended):**
       - **Size:** ~9GB
       - **Entries:** ~200 million unique SHA-1 hashed passwords
       - **Link Valid Until:** *January 11, 2026*

    2. **PwnedPasswordsDownloader:**
       - **Size:** ~40GB
       - **Entries:** ~900 million unique SHA-1 hashed passwords
       - **Note:** The file must be named `pwnedpasswords.txt` and placed in the **root** of the project folder.
       - [Download from PwnedPasswordsDownloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader)

    The databases are sourced from the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) project and made available for offline analysis.
