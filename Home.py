    ### Welcome to the Password Breach Detection Tool
    This tool helps you check if your password has been compromised in known data breaches. It also allows you to:
    - Search for a specific password in the database.
    - Download and manage the breached passwords database.
    - Analyze the most frequently seen passwords in breaches.
    - Add your own passwords to the database for testing purposes.

    **Currently using a 9GB database containing over 200 million SHA-1 hashed passwords!**

    The database is sourced from the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) project and downloaded using tools provided by [Pwned Passwords Downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader). It is hosted on my Google Drive for easy access.
